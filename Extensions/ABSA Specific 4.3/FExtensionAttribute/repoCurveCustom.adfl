[ABSA Specific 4.3]FInstrumentAndTrades:repoCurveCustom = 
# Implemented for Front Arena Upgrade 2013. Front Arena 2010 returned the rpeo curve name and 2013 returned the repo curve ame with the currency seperated by a comma. This is causing issues downstream with column shifts and change in repo curve name representation downstream. This implementation will only return the Repo Curve name with the currency.
