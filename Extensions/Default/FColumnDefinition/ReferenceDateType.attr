  Description=MtM-prices for inflation price indices are typically stored once per month (exact price Date is in that case irrelevant), this setting determines when these prices are assumed to be applicable for valuation and internal start date for corresponding inflation curve. Note that this setting is unrelated to any lag which is determined by the Index Type setting.
