[Default]FObject:prepayment =
  Description=Shift of all prepayment values in a scenario. The specified shift value(s) are interpreted as absolute values in decimal form added to the current prepayment values (for example, 0.1 implies an additional prepayment of 10% of the nominal value), as fixed values in decimal form replacing the current prepayment values (for example, 0.1 implies a total prepayment of 10% of the nominal value), or as relative changes in percentage terms of the current prepayment values (for example, 10% implies that the total prepayment increases by a factor of 1.1).
