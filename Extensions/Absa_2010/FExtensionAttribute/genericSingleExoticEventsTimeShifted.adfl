# Adjustment to usage of "timeShiftDividendAdjustedFixings" function.
# Number and type of arguments for this method have changed between 2010.2 and 2013.3.
# The comparison between the [Default] use of the method in 2010.2 and the FOption customisation
# has been made and the same changes merged into the [Default] implementation for
# FInstrument in 2013.3. At this stage, this a technical migration which assumes behavioural
# equivalence between the [Default] implementation in 2010.2 and 2013.3.
