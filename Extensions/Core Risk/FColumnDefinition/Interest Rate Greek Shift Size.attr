[Core Risk]FTradingSheet:Interest Rate Greek Shift Size =
  Description=Curves are internally shifted with this shift size (system default is 0.001 basis points), mainly for better accuracy when performing non-rectangular bucket shifts. The resulting change in value is in turn scaled appropriately to produce a result that corresponds to the definition of the column (typically a 1 basis point curve change).
