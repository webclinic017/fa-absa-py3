  AggregationFunction=Unsupported
  Description=The number of hedge contracts needed in order to hedge the interest rate forward delta for a position in a certain time bucket. The column automatically selects hedge instruments based on time buckets chosen and by retreiving currency information found on grouping rows or the instrument. If the time bucket specifies a 3 month IMM period, a 3 month rate index future is used as hedge instrument, otherwise a virtual FRA instrument matching the time bucket period is used.
