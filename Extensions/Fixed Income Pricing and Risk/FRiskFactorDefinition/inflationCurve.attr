  CompactDisplayName=Zero Coupon Rates/Parallel
  Description=Parallel shift of all curves of type Inflation and Seasonality in a scenario. The shifts are applied to the zero coupon rate values (in the curve Calculation Format). If only a Seasonality curve is shifted (by for example using a Filter) the shifts are only applied on the base Inflation curve (as a Seasonality curve has no definition of zero coupon rates). The specified shift value(s) are either interpreted as absolute numbers of basis points added to the current zero coupon rate values or as relative changes in percentage terms of the current zero coupon rate values.
